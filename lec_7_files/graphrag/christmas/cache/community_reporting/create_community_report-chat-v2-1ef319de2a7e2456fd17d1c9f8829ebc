Initially depicted as a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, with a cold demeanor that affects his physical appearance and social interactions, Scrooge is known for his miserly ways and skeptical nature, particularly towards ghosts and the supernatural. He prefers darkness, indicating his miserly nature, and is skeptical of the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns him about the consequences of his miserly life.\n\nScrooge's journey begins with a series of ghostly visits that lead him to reflect on his past, present, and future. He is visited by spirits showing him past Christmas experiences and interactions, including a Christmas ball hosted by Fezziwig, which brings him both joy and sorrow. The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds him of past Christmases, softening his initial dislike for the holiday. He is curious about the Spirit's actions and questions the Spirit's intentions regarding Christmas traditions and the poor. Throughout these visits, Scrooge shows reluctance and fear but also curiosity about the supernatural events unfolding around him. He observes interactions among businessmen and contemplates changes in his life and the importance of conversations he overhears, particularly concerning Tiny Tim's well-being and future, which he inquires about with concern.\n\nScrooge's transformation is marked by his profound experience of redemption over the course of Christmas Eve night, during which he is tormented by spirits showing him past, present, and future events to reflect on his life choices and attitudes towards wealth and happiness. This leads him to show regret for his past actions and fear of a lonely death, as shown by his reaction to the vision of his own grave. Ultimately, Scrooge becomes a generous man, raises Bob Cratchit's salary, and acts as a second father to Tiny Tim. He engages in the festivities, guesses in games, and experiences a change of heart, resolving to improve his ways and embrace the spirit of Christmas, thereby transforming his approach to life and his interactions with others, including his employee Bob Cratchit and his nephew Fred.

Initially, Bob Cratchit's relationship with Scrooge is purely that of an employee to a rather cold and miserly employer, with Bob even referring to Scrooge as the \"\"Founder of the Feast\"\" in a display of respect and perhaps a touch of irony, considering Scrooge's initial lack of generosity. This dynamic begins to shift dramatically when Scrooge, influenced by his nocturnal revelations and a changing perspective on life and his own legacy, decides to raise Bob Cratchit's salary and assist his struggling family.
