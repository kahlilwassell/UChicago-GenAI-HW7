    "Answer": " The main themes of the book are redemption, the consequences of greed and selfishness, and the importance of compassion and generosity towards others. ",
    "Reference": "The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;\nand, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her\nchildren were.\n\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked\nup and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the\nwindow, glanced at the clock, tried, but in vain, to work with her\nneedle, and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.\n\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,\nand met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though\nhe was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of\nserious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to\nrepress.\n\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,\nand when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a\nlong silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n\n'Is it good,' she said, 'or bad?' to help him.\n\n'Bad,' he answered.'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve."
