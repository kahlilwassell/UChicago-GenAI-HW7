RUNNING SHOE BIOMECHANICS — DETAILED ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------

Running shoe biomechanics integrates principles of physics, materials science, and human gait mechanics to optimize performance and reduce injury risk.

===================
1. MIDSOLE FOAM
===================

Modern foams use:
- PEBA (e.g., ZoomX, Lightstrike Pro)
- TPU blends (e.g., Boost)
- EVA variants

Key properties:
- **Energy return**
- **Compression resistance**
- **Density**
- **Resilience over repeated loading cycles**

========================
2. CARBON PLATE DYNAMICS
========================

Carbon plates act as:
- Lever arms that reduce ankle dorsiflexion
- Structures that stiffen the forefoot
- Tools to shift work from small foot muscles to larger proximal musculature

Benefits:
- Improved running economy (1–4%)
- Reduced fatigue in calf/ankle complex

=========================
3. STACK HEIGHT & GEOMETRY
=========================

High-stack shoes reduce:
- Ground reaction force impact
- Peak tibial acceleration

Rockers increase:
- Forward propulsion
- Smooth transition from heel to toe-off

============================
4. PRONATION & STABILITY
============================

Old-school pronation control is outdated.  
Modern stability uses:
- Wider base  
- Rearfoot geometry  
- Sidewalls  
- Dual-density foams  

Stability ≠ motion control anymore; it is *guidance*.

====================================
5. INJURY CONSIDERATIONS
====================================

Different design features affect injury risk:
- Higher stack height → lower impact loading but instability risk  
- Stiff plates → reduced calf work but increased hip demand  
- Minimalist shoes → increased foot intrinsic activation  

====================================
TAKEAWAY
====================================

Running shoe biomechanics is a system of interacting variables—foam, geometry, stiffness, and fit—and optimizing performance depends on balancing energy return, stability, and muscle loading.
