Usain Bolt is a retired Jamaican sprinter widely regarded as the fastest human ever.
He dominated the 100-meter and 200-meter events, winning eight Olympic gold medals
and setting world records in both distances. Bolt's world record of 9.58 seconds
in the 100 meters, set in 2009, remains one of the most iconic achievements in sports history.

Known for his signature “Lightning Bolt” celebration, his exceptional acceleration,
and his ability to separate from competitors in the final phases of races,
Bolt became a global symbol of athletic excellence. After retiring from track and field,
he pursued ventures in entertainment, business, and philanthropy, continuing to inspire
young athletes around the world.
