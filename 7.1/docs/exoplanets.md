# Exoplanets

Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our Solar System.
The first confirmed exoplanet discoveries occurred in the early 1990s,
and since then thousands have been detected through methods such as:

- **Transit photometry**: Observing a star's dimming as a planet passes in front.
- **Radial velocity**: Detecting stellar wobble caused by an orbiting planet's gravity.
- **Direct imaging**: Capturing visual images of exoplanets with advanced telescopes.

## Types of Exoplanets

### Hot Jupiters
Gas giants that orbit extremely close to their stars, often with periods of only a few days.

### Super-Earths
Rocky planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, often candidates for habitability.

### Mini-Neptunes
Small gas or ice planets with thick atmospheres.

### Earth-like Worlds
Planets in the habitable zone where conditions *may* allow for liquid water.

## Why Exoplanets Matter
Studying exoplanets helps astronomers:
- Understand how planetary systems form and evolve
- Assess the diversity of planetary environments
- Identify potentially habitable worlds
- Search for biosignatures or atmospheric markers of life

## The Future
Upcoming missions like NASA's **Roman Space Telescope** and ESA's **PLATO** will expand
the search for exoplanets, especially those resembling Earth in size and orbit.
These missions aim to deepen our understanding of planetary systems and the possibility
of life elsewhere in the universe.
